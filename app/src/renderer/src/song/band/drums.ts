// Drum generation: turns the beat grid, the section plans and the style's grooves into timed drum notes. Pure: no audio and no store.
// Every bar is placed on the real beats, so a part follows tempo drift. Humanising is not done here; that is a later layer.
//
// Random draws are kept independent of the musical choices where it matters. A fill is always drawn, whether it is on or not, so
// turning one fill on changes only that bar and the rest of the song keeps its notes. Complexity does not draw at all: a hit's tier
// decides whether it plays, so every bar of a groove is the same at a fixed complexity.
